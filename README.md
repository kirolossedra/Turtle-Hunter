# Turtle-Hunter
### I divided the project into two stages:

#### 1- first turtle finder is a navigator service that if given a certain point it calculates the slope and angular velocity and linear velocity and moves the turtle from current position to given position
#### 2- second the random turtle generator generates a turtle and publishes it for a client that puts it in a queue and passes it to turtle finder one by one and once finished removes it from the queue and then sends the next
